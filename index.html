<p><img src="http://s27.postimg.org/t6zgw00wz/logo.png" alt="logo"></p>

<p>Emergency Medical Response is not something to take lightly; a few minutes in delayed response time, or a few omitted pieces of crucial information, can tip the balance between life and death to its more tragic end.</p>

<p>Our service, <strong>EIR</strong> (named for the Norse God of medical skill), is designed to augment the traditional <em>911</em> emergency response service, by </p>

<ul>
<li>better informing medical personnel with more detailed descriptors, via video  and geolocation, about exactly where, and what, occurred in an accident.</li>
<li>providing medical personnel with an easier, more panic-proof way of giving instructions to those at the scene, via our diagrammatic Canvas and a simple text interface.</li>
</ul>

<p>The application itself consists of an <strong>Android App</strong>, for someone at the scene of an accident to call for help, and a <strong>Web Application</strong>, which is designed for a medical responder to communicate with the caller more effectively than is possible through traditional, voice-only communication in a <em>911</em> call.</p>

<p>These two applications communicate through <strong>HTTP GET</strong> requests, communicated to a <strong>Django Server</strong> on the Linode hosting service. Our audio and video calling is implemented through the <strong>Sinch</strong> API, and the Canvas drawing system is implemented through an implementation of <strong>HTML5's Canvas Element</strong>.</p>
